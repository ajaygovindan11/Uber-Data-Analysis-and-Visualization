✅ Project Title: Uber Ride Data Analysis and Visualisation Using Power BI

📘 Overview: What the Project is About: This project involves analysing Uber ride data to uncover patterns in customer behaviour, pricing trends, travel modes, and regional usage. 
Using Power BI, the analysis converts raw ride data into meaningful dashboards that support strategic business decisions.

🏢 Business Problem Being Solved
Uber needs to:
* Understand when and where demand is highest
* Optimise fare pricing and travel mode offerings
* Improve resource allocation and customer experience
* Identify high-traffic locations and ride patterns

This analysis provides insight into these areas by exploring temporal, geographic, and behavioural trends.

🧰 Tools & Technologies Used
* Power BI: For dashboard creation and data visualisation.
* Excel (assumed): For initial data handling.
* SQL: The intention of SQL (often pronounced sequel) is to store, retrieve, manage and manipulate data within a database management system.

🔗 Data Sources
The project uses Uber ride data with fields like:
* pickup_datetime
* fare_amount
* passenger_count
* travel_mode
* pickup and dropoff coordinates
Add a link to the dataset if it is public, or state "Simulated for academic purposes."

🔍 Methodology
1. Data Collection – Obtained Uber ride dataset
2. Data Cleaning – Removed null values, corrected formats
3. Data Transformation – Aggregated by time, location, and ride type
4. Visualisation – Built interactive dashboards in Power BI to analyse:
   * Fare trends (yearly, monthly, daily)
   * Ride mode popularity
   * Peak hours and locations
   * Passenger count distribution
   * Price and distance by travel mode

📊 Key Insights / Findings
* 📈 2013 saw peak fare totals; 2014 had a significant drop.
* 🗓️ May shows the highest monthly fare amounts.
* 🕒 Peak hours: 7–9 AM and 5–8 PM.
* 🚘 Uber Go is the most used travel mode (66.8%).
* 📍 Most rides happen in urban areas across North America and Asia.
* 💰 Uber Premium has the highest average fares and longest distances.

🖼️ Screenshots of Dashboards / Charts: You can include or upload 2–3 dashboard screenshots here. If you'd like, I can help create placeholder images or extract them from your 
presentation if available.

📂 How to Use the Project Files
1. Go to the presentation/ folder.
2. Open the UBER ANALYSIS (Business Analyst) .pdf file.
3. Review the visualisations and conclusions by slide.
4. (Optional) Check the /data and /visuals folders for raw files and graphs (if added later).

✅ Conclusion / Business Recommendations
* 📌 Focus fleet availability in high-demand times and locations (morning/evening, urban centres).
* 💸 Optimise pricing with demand-based adjustments to avoid losses in off-peak times.
* 🚗 Promote Uber Go in budget-focused markets; position Uber Premium for long-distance or premium rides.
* 📈 Invest in regional strategies based on geospatial demand clusters.
